//CNOT
//measure Qubit

/*
I have given you all my updated project files. Now I wish to implement quantum entanglement between qubits. Firstly give me a rugh ideea how would that be implemented. Secondly I already have a CNOT gate function but it doesnt work as intended as when update function is called after CNOT function it removes its progres. That makes it so that I cant apply any more gates after the first CNOT gate. How could that be fixed?
